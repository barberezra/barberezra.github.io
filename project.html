        <h2 style="max-width: 50%; padding: 1em;">Overview</h2>
        <p style="max-width: 50%; padding: 1em;">This project contains features designed to address issues or desires that users shared with us during our interview sessions. One feature that the webpage has is the ability for users to send quick feedback about any machines in their dorms, as well as the ability to pick a default dorm and save it. We addressed another major desire from users by including color-coded machine images so that users can tell whether a machine is available, in use, or out of service. This allows users to quickly tell the status of their dorm's laundry room with a cursory glance.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 style="max-width: 50%; padding: 1em;"><abbr title="User eXperience">UX</abbr> Evaluation Process</h2>
        <p style="max-width: 50%; padding: 1em;">To conduct interviews, we used a process combining think-aloud interviewing and focus group sessions. The think-aloud interviews hosted a single interviewee and the focus groups accommodated several people per session. Our user evaluation process consisted of three main user tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users can see how much time is left on each machine in their dormitory</li>
            <li>Users can see which machines are out of order</li>
            <li>Users can select a default dormitory to save their preferences</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 style="max-width: 50%; padding: 1em;">What worked well?</h3>
            <p style="max-width: 50%; padding: 1em;">Users reported that using our prototypes was intuitive and quick to respond.</p>
        <h4 style="max-width: 50%; padding: 1em;">What needed improvement?</h4>
        <p style="max-width: 50%; padding: 1em;">Some features, such as the pop up elements from a clickable machine, did not close properly. Our applications also contained some ambiguity as to what each color represented, because we used a range of colors such as gray, red, yellow, green and blue with very little standardization across our prototypes.</p>
