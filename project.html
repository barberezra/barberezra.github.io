        <p style="max-width: 25%; padding: 2em;">This project contains features designed to address issues or desires that users shared with us during our interview sessions. One feature that the webpage has is the ability for users to send quick feedback about any machines in their dorms, as well as the ability to pick a default dorm and save it. We addressed another major desire from users by including color-coded machine images so that users can tell whether a machine is available, in use, or out of service. This allows users to quickly tell the status of their dorm's laundry room with a cursory glance.</p>
