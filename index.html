        <p class="bio">My name is Ezra Barber, and I am a senior computer science major at Carleton College. My senior capstone project involved designing a tool implementing ARP spoofing and SSL stripping attacks to gain user login information. I am interested in software development, specifically in the environmental science and cybersecurity industries.In my spare time, I like to play the saxophone, solve Rubik's Cubes, and go hiking.</p>
